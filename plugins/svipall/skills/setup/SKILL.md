description: Install and configure Svipall on this machine — detect or install the binary, verify the MCP server answers, offer the browser download, and optionally make Svipall the preferred way this user reaches the web. Use when the user runs /svipall:setup, asks to set up or install Svipall, or when a Svipall MCP tool fails because the server is not there.

# Set up Svipall

Work through the steps in order. **Never run an install command, and never write to the user's
files, without showing exactly what you are about to do and getting a yes.** Nothing here is
urgent enough to justify surprising someone.

Report at the end: what changed, and how to undo it.

## 1. Is it already here?

```bash
svipall --version
```

- **It answers** with a JSON object → note the `version` and `target`, go to step 3.
- **Command not found** → step 2.

## 2. Install the binary

Work out the platform (`uname -s`/`uname -m`, or `$env:OS` on Windows), then show the user the
matching command from this table and ask before running it. Prefer a package manager they already
have — it is the one that will also upgrade Svipall later.

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux, Homebrew present | `brew install ilien-dev/svipall/svipall` |
| macOS / Linux, otherwise | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilien-dev/svipall/main/install.sh \| sh` |
| Windows, Scoop present | `scoop bucket add svipall https://github.com/ilien-dev/scoop-svipall; scoop install svipall` |
| Windows, winget present | `winget install ilien-dev.svipall` |
| Windows, otherwise | `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilien-dev/svipall/main/install.ps1 \| iex` |
| Any, prefers a container | `docker pull ghcr.io/ilien-dev/svipall:latest` |

After a script install, `svipall --version` may still fail in **this** shell because PATH was
changed for new shells only. Try the absolute path the installer printed (`~/.local/bin/svipall`,
or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\svipall\svipall.exe`) before concluding anything went wrong, and tell
the user to open a new terminal.

If the user chose Docker, the MCP command is
`docker run -i --rm -v svipall-home:/data ghcr.io/ilien-dev/svipall:latest` — see step 4.

## 3. Check the installation

```bash
svipall doctor
```

It returns one JSON object. `ok: true` means there is nothing to do. Otherwise walk `problems[]`
and relay each `message` with its `fix`, in the object's own words. Two you will meet often:

- `no_browser` — offer `svipall browser install`. **Say that it downloads about 190 MB** and wait
  for a yes. Only the plain http tier works without it, so any page behind a challenge stays
  blocked; that is a real limitation to state, not a detail to skip.
- `dashboard_port_busy` — usually a `svipall-mcp` already running. Harmless; say so.

## 4. Wire up the MCP server

This plugin already ships an MCP entry that runs `svipall-mcp` from PATH, so if step 1 or 2
succeeded there is normally nothing to do. Confirm it by calling any Svipall MCP tool — for
instance `web_status`.

If the tools are not there:

- **The binary is not on PATH for the process that launched Claude Code.** Register it by absolute
  path instead: `claude mcp add -s user svipall -- /absolute/path/to/svipall-mcp`
- **Docker install.** `claude mcp add -s user svipall -- docker run -i --rm -v svipall-home:/data ghcr.io/ilien-dev/svipall:latest`

Either way, tell the user to restart Claude Code afterwards.

## 5. Offer: prefer Svipall for web access (optional)

Ask, do not assume. This writes to the user's **global** memory, which affects every project they
open.

> "Want Claude to reach for Svipall instead of the built-in web fetch, in every project? It adds
> one import line to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and a file next to it. `/svipall:uninstall` removes
> both."

On yes:

1. Copy the plugin's `memory/SVIPALL.md` to `~/.claude/svipall/SVIPALL.md`, creating the directory.
   That file is at `../../memory/SVIPALL.md` relative to this skill — resolve it from this file's
   own path, not from the working directory. If you cannot find it, fetch
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilien-dev/svipall/main/plugins/svipall/memory/SVIPALL.md`
   instead of writing your own version of it. Overwriting the destination is fine — it is ours.
2. Read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (create it empty if absent). **Show the exact block you are about to
   add and get a second yes**, because this is somebody's own file:

   ```
   <!-- BEGIN SVIPALL -->
   @svipall/SVIPALL.md
   <!-- END SVIPALL -->
   ```

3. Copy `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.bak-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>` first.
4. If the markers are already present, replace what is between them. Otherwise append the block.
   Never add a second copy, and never touch anything outside the markers.

## 6. Offer: strict mode (default: no)

> "There is also a strict mode: Claude Code's own `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` get declined with a
> pointer to the Svipall tool that does the same job. Off unless you ask for it."

On yes, create the empty marker file `~/.svipall/claude_strict`. Deleting it turns strict mode off
again, immediately, with no restart. Leave it alone if the user did not ask.

## 7. Say what happened

List, plainly: the binary and where it landed, whether the browser was installed, whether the
memory block was added, whether strict mode is on, and that `/svipall:uninstall` reverses the last
three. If anything was left undone — a `doctor` problem the user declined to fix — say that too
rather than reporting success.
