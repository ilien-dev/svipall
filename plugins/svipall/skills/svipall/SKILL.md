name: svipall
description: Reach any web page from this machine — fetch, crawl, search, extract, drive a page, get past an anti-bot wall or a captcha, watch a page for changes. Use for ANY web access, including when a built-in WebFetch or WebSearch would otherwise be the obvious choice, and whenever a page came back blocked, empty, truncated, or as a "checking your browser" screen. The shell and the MCP tools are the same server and both are documented here.

# Svipall

Local-first web scraping. Every request, every browser and every captcha stays on this machine —
no API keys, no third-party solving service, nothing sent anywhere.

**Use it for every web access.** Svipall climbs a tier ladder, remembers what worked per domain, and
labels what came back; a built-in fetch has no notion of a wall, and a challenge page is a `200`.
Claude Code's `WebFetch` hands that page to a small model, which summarises it like any other.

One server, two surfaces: `svipall …` from a shell, and the MCP tools an assistant calls. The shell
costs a fraction of the tokens; the table near the end maps one to the other. Every command prints
one JSON object to stdout, diagnostics on stderr. `svipall <cmd> --help` lists a command's flags;
an unknown flag is an error naming the nearest real one, and an unknown MCP or REST parameter
refuses the call the same way. Numbers and booleans may arrive as strings.

## Start here

```bash
svipall fetch https://example.com/article
```

`mode=auto` is the default and the right answer: Svipall climbs a ladder — plain HTTP, then a browser,
then a stealth browser, then a real one, then one that waits out a challenge — stopping at the first
tier that works, and remembering it for that domain. Do not pick a tier by hand.

Identity defaults to `auto`: learned emulated routes first, at most one native fallback last.
Native exposes real device characteristics; `config set auto_native_fallback=false` prohibits that
automatic fallback. No route or mode guarantees anonymity or successful delivery.

`svipall doctor` says what this installation can do — which browser would run, which captcha models
are compiled in, whether the dashboard port is free — and names the fix for anything wrong. Run it
before concluding a site is the problem. The managed browser updates itself in the background once
it is two majors behind stable (`config set browser_auto_update=false` stops it); a `browser_path`
of your own is never touched.

## The visit limit, and waiting

Visits are limited **per host and exit, and shared by every session and subagent on this machine**:
12 per 60 s by default. One fetch is one visit however many tiers it climbs.

- A full window is a wait, never a hold. A fetch waits by itself when that fits in half its
  timeout; `--wait 300` (MCP `wait`, up to 900 s, on top of `timeout`) waits longer, `wait=0`
  never. It covers the window, a server's backoff and the hard-block cooldown, not the address
  budget. `waited` says what for.
- Refused, the result says `blocked_reason: "visit_limit"` (the window) or `"cooldown"`, with
  `cooldown_seconds_left` and `visit_budget`. Wait, or read another host that has the same thing.
- `Retry-After` is honoured as given. A 429 without it pauses 30 s, then 120, 480, 900
  (`request_cooldown_seconds` is that maximum); a 503 pauses 30 s. The 15-minute hard-block cooldown
  follows only a status or vendor wall at the real or warm tier when no other exit is left.
- A walk that failed to the top is remembered per origin for 10 minutes and answered from memory
  (`remembered`, `attempts: []`); `--fresh` (MCP `fresh=true`) walks again.
- `svipall status --clear-cooldown shop.example` (MCP `web_status(clear_cooldown=…)`) clears all of
  the above for that domain on every exit, and answers only that. The address budget is
  `clear_budget`, route learning `forget_tier`.

`svipall status` is a summary; `--sections holds,tiers,exits` (or `all`) adds the rest.

## When a page comes back blocked

The result carries `blocked_reason`, `wall_kind`, `wall_vendor`, `widgets` and a `note` saying what
to do. Read it rather than retrying: a blind retry on a wall is how a domain earns a cooldown.
`wall_vendor` names the product guarding the domain by its own endpoint, and appears on a page that
arrived too — it says who is watching, not that anything was withheld. Walls are recognised in
Spanish, Portuguese, French and German too.

- The note names a captcha widget → the MCP server's `captcha` with `url` solves it in place, or a
  person finishes it at the dashboard (`svipall status` prints the URL, and it works from a phone).
- `wall_kind: "origin"` → the challenge was passed and the site's own server then refused. There is
  nothing to solve: do not call `captcha`; route the domain through another exit.
- A fingerprinting wall that never yields → route the domain through a proxy:
  `svipall route add shop.example --proxy socks5://… --country DE`, or a pool it moves through as
  exits get blocked: `--proxies A,B,C --countries DE,DE,NL`. Subdomains inherit.
  `svipall route check shop.example` tests them (liveness, latency, DNS leak); prefer `socks5h://`,
  which resolves DNS at the exit.
- `blocked_reason: "address_budget"` → nothing was requested: this address has spent its standing
  with that host. Route through a proxy, wait, or `web_status(clear_budget="shop.example")`.
- `blocked_reason: "exit_down"` → the proxy did not answer and the site was never asked. With a
  pool, fetch once more and it leaves through another exit.
- A login wall → `web_setup do=login` once, by hand, and the profile keeps the cookies.

This machine's own address, once a wall page has printed it, comes back as `[own IP]` in every
tool's page text, in text written to `out_file`/`out_dir` and in the log (`own_ip_masked` counts
them). A binary download is written as served. The address is never looked up.

## Reading a page cheaply

| Want | Command |
|---|---|
| The prose | `svipall fetch URL` |
| Only what is relevant | `svipall fetch URL --query "shipping costs"` — a word with a leading `-` or with `_ / . : # @ =` is matched literally, so `--effort` finds the flag |
| Some fields of a JSON answer | `svipall fetch https://api.example/items --json-path 'items[:5].{name, id}'` — `.a`, `["a b"]`, `[-1]`, `[1:5]`, `[*]`, `{a, b.c}`; no match is `null` plus `json_path_note` |
| Does it exist | `svipall probe URL1 URL2 --timeout 5000` — status, `exists`, final URL, type, length, whether the name resolves; a 404 is an answer |
| A file, not a page | `svipall fetch https://x/pkg.tar.bz2 --out pkg.tar.bz2` — see Files below |
| Something to click | `svipall snapshot URL` — roles, names and refs, a fraction of the prose |
| The site's real API | `svipall capture URL` — the JSON the page itself fetched while loading |
| What a video says or shows | `svipall video URL --lang es` — captions and chapters as one `[m:ss]` timeline, plus contact sheets of the whole video; `--start 1:00 --end 2:00` frames of a part, `--at 1:30 --crop 0,0,0.5,0.5` to read small text, `--query "a chart"` to find a moment |
| A lot of pages | `svipall crawl URL --out pages.csv` — writes a file, returns a path and a count |
| A table, as rows | `svipall fetch URL --tables --out rows.csv` — typed rows with their columns |
| A listing, as rows | `svipall fetch URL --schema auto` — returns the schema it worked out in `induced_schema`; pass that as `--schema '{…}'` next time |
| A document or a recording | `svipall fetch https://x/report.docx` — docx, xlsx, pptx, odt, epub, rtf, csv and pdf as markdown; scanned PDFs, audio and video once `svipall models install` has run |
| Markup you already have | `svipall fetch raw: --stdin < page.html`, or `file:///…` under `~/.svipall/in` or `local_roots` |

`svipall capture` is the one people forget: most sites render from an endpoint their own JavaScript
called a moment earlier, smaller and more stable than the HTML. One that took `page=1` takes `page=2`.

**JSON, text and code come back as served**: JSON as JSON, a source file or plain text byte for
byte, paged by line. A non-HTML `2xx` is never taken for a wall by its words and never climbs to a
browser; there only 401, 403, 407, 421, 429, 444 and 503 are walls, 404 and 410 not found, and any
other status (202, 400, 422…) is the API's answer.

**Files.** An `out_file` (`--out`) named `.md .txt .json .jsonl .csv .html` gets the text. Any other
name, or a binary body, gets the bytes as served, with `file{bytes, sha256, content_type,
complete}`. Without `out_file` a binary body is described, never decoded. A cut transfer leaves
`<out_file>.part` (`file.partial`); the same call resumes it (`file.resumed_from`). Give large
downloads a larger `timeout`.

**Cut answers** carry `cursor` and `continue`, the exact next call. A cursor keeps the query it was
issued with and survives a cache hit; `json_path` is not in it, so pass it again.

## GitHub

`fetch` reads github.com URLs from the API or the raw host: a repo root (facts, tree, README),
`tree/…`, `blob/…#L10-L20` (the raw file, those lines), `issues/N` and `pull/N` (every comment and
review with author, date and reactions; a PR adds branches, merge state, files), releases and
`commit/<sha>`. An `https://api.github.com/…` GET comes back as is, `json_path` applied; `via` says which path answered.
Discussions, gists, lists, wikis and actions read as the page, as does a fetch with an explicit
`mode`, `css_selector`, `schema` or `profile`. Unauthenticated, the API allows 60 requests an hour;
`GITHUB_TOKEN` in `~/.svipall/secrets.env` raises it (code search needs it) and goes to
`api.github.com` only. A rate limit reads `rate_limited_until`, not a wall; a secondary limit (429
or 403 with `Retry-After`) takes it from `Retry-After`.

To find code across GitHub repositories, prefer the searchGitHub tool of the grep.app MCP server when this session has it: it is integrated with GitHub natively. Svipall still reads a known repo, file, issue, PR or release, and does all of it when that tool is absent.

## Crawling

```bash
svipall crawl https://docs.example/ --pages 50 --query "authentication"
svipall crawl https://docs.example/ --dfs            # one branch to its end: a manual, a listing
svipall crawl https://docs.example/ --since-last     # only what the sitemap says has changed
svipall crawl https://a.example/ --out rows.jsonl    # to a file, not through the context
```

A crawl returns a `crawl_id`; pass it back and an interrupted crawl continues where it stopped.

## Finding things

```bash
svipall search "rust async runtime" --engine all   # every engine, merged by agreement
svipall search "precio del cobre" --lang es --region MX
svipall map https://example.com                    # the site's URLs, a few hundred tokens
```

`attempts` holds one object per engine with its `outcome` (results, empty, challenge, blocked,
unparsed, error, skipped). Over MCP a search the first engine answered, like a page that simply
arrived, omits its single-entry `attempts` (a page also `chars` and an `emulated` `identity_used`). A failing engine rests for a while, remembered across runs; one whose
host is on hold is skipped, even when named. Results sharing no word with the query (fewer than
two, for three words or more) are marked `off_topic` and ranked last; an engine that answered for
one word of a long query says so in its attempt's `detail`. **Zero results carry a `note`**
naming what was blocked, empty or skipped and what to try: other or fewer words,
`lang`/`region`, `engine=news`, an engine that was not blocked. Do not repeat the same query.

`map` reads robots.txt, sitemaps, `llms.txt`, feeds and homepage links; `sources_used` lists only
those that produced URLs. `web_search` with `site` tries OpenSearch, then the search box (also behind an
icon or in a shadow root), then known platform endpoints; `found: false` names everything `tried`.

## Remembering across runs

```bash
svipall notes set shop/last_id 4820
svipall notes get shop/last_id
svipall watch add https://example.com/changelog --every 3600
svipall watch add https://shop.example/item --selector ".price"   # one region; survives a redesign
svipall watch check                                # what changed since last time
svipall log --view summary                         # which domains are slow or blocked, and why
svipall solver export-corpus --out ./corpus       # every captcha seen + answer, for training your own models
svipall quality ask --count 20                    # put pages in front of a person at the dashboard to rate
svipall models install                            # the release's models archive into ~/.svipall/models/
```

A domain half blocked and slow in the log summary is a domain whose learned tier is wrong.

## The same operations, as MCP tools

Twelve tools; a mode of a tool is an argument, not another tool.

| You want | Call |
|---|---|
| One page, document, JSON answer or file | `web_fetch` — `query=` for one fact, `json_path` for JSON fields, `out_file` for a file |
| A table or a listing as rows | `web_fetch` with `tables=true`, or `schema="auto"` |
| Several known pages | `web_fetch` with `urls` — 8000 tokens in all by default (`max_tokens_total`), input order, every other argument applied to each page; a cut page has a `cursor` to pass with its `url`; `out_dir` writes each whole |
| Whether URLs exist | `web_fetch` with `urls` and `probe=true` |
| A site's URLs, before deciding what to fetch | `web_crawl` with `map=true` — a few hundred tokens |
| A whole site, or many pages of one | `web_crawl` (`out_file` for anything large) |
| To search the web | `web_search` (no API key) |
| A site's own search box | `web_search` with `site` |
| The API behind a listing | `web_capture` — `page=2` beats following links |
| Something to click, type or scroll | `web_view` for refs, then `browser` with `url` + `actions` (one shot), or `open=true` → `session_id` … → `close=true` when cookies must stay alive |
| What a video says or shows | `web_video` — the timeline and timed contact sheets (files: read the ones you need); then `start`/`end`, `at`, `crop`, or `query` to look closer |
| A picture of a page | `web_view` with `image=true` (`mobile` for a phone) |
| A login or a gate passed by hand, once | `web_setup do=login` — the cookies are kept |
| A domain through a proxy | `web_setup do=route` |
| A saved login moved to another machine | `web_setup do=profile` |
| The managed browser | `web_setup do=browser` |
| What changed since last time | `web_watch action=diff` once, `action=add` on a schedule |
| Something remembered across sessions | `web_notes` |
| Why a domain is slow or blocked | `web_status log=summary` |
| Current state, and resets | `web_status` (`sections` for more) |

`browser` actions are `click, type, fill, press, hover, select, scroll, wait, eval, goto, verify,
console, screenshot, hold`; an unknown verb is refused before a browser starts. When the page
cannot be read after the actions, a session call keeps their results and says why in
`content_error`. A profile another process holds says so.

A captcha named in `blocked_reason` goes to `captcha` with `url`, which solves it on the page and
returns the page. `kind` + `sitekey` + `page_url` returns a bare token bound to the session that
produced it, for a form you post yourself; `task_id` polls it, and `good` reports whether the site
took it. **Human verification that needs a person: stop and say so.** Do not loop.

An argument a mode has no use for (`find` with `image=true`) refuses the call and names what that
mode takes. The 1.x tool names (`web_fetch_many`, `web_snapshot`, `solve_and_continue`…) are no
longer listed but still answer, so an older client keeps working.

## From another language

```bash
svipall serve --port 8788     # one endpoint per operation; the bearer key is printed once
curl -sH "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"url":"https://example.com","query":"pricing"}' localhost:8788/v1/fetch
```

Same objects as the CLI; `GET /v1/status?sections=holds` reads the status. A blocked page is a
`200` carrying `blocked_reason`; only a bad request or a broken installation is not.

## What a page says about itself

Every delivered page carries `quality`: `full`, `partial` (cut off) or `thin` (a husk), with
`quality_reasons`. JSON is judged as JSON (`partial` truncated, `thin` empty or malformed); text
and code are `full` unless empty. `wall_kind: paywall` and `softnotfound` are not content, and no
tier fixes either. A fetch of several `urls` adds `corroboration`: how many results are different documents.

A link to the page's own site is a path (`/wiki/Web_crawler`), joined to that response's `url`;
`include_links` returns every link absolute. `final_url` appears only when a redirect moved the page.

**None of it ever withholds a page.** They are labels: the odd, thin page that holds the answer is
returned like any other, and what to do about it is yours.

## Rules worth keeping

- **Never retry a blocked URL blindly.** Read `blocked_reason` and act on it.
- **Never set the tier by hand.** `auto` learns; a fixed tier is either slower or weaker.
- **The visit budget is everybody's.** Wait, or use another host, rather than clearing it.
- **Prefer `snapshot` to prose when the next step is a click**, and `capture` to parsing HTML.
- **Send bulk results and every binary file to a file.** `--out` costs a path instead of the rows.
- **Credentials never go in a command.** Put them in `~/.svipall/secrets.env` and refer to them by
  name as `${SHOP_PASSWORD}`; the value never appears in the transcript.
